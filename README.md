## How to run the program

## Work Distribution

	Through Discord, our team was able to communicate with 
one another to provide guidance and reminders of tasks for the 
project. With Github and Git, we were also able to pull from our 
main branch so that we could all work on the project individually 
while having the most up to date code. The work was distributed 
between the group through writing code, creating documents, as well 
as providing the group with guidance to ensure completion of the project.
	
	I, Christian Verry, contributed by first providing information 
about the chapter 3 slides that would help guide us through the 
project and what the project consisted of. I also provided code for 
the init functions in both the sender.cpp and recv.cpp. As I struggled
with the other tasks within the project, my group members were able 
to help solve the problems and provide the code needed. Lastly, my 
contribution consisted of creating and writing parts of the README.md 
and helping with the design documentation.
