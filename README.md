## How to run the program
Open up two command prompts/terminals then use the following commands:
1. ./sender \<filename\>.\<ext\> in one terminal
2. ./recv in the other
3. You will see that the terminal with the sender program
   will show that it found a receive flag and sent the relevant
   data to the receiver program.
4. You will see a new file with __recv appended to the end of it, which
   should be a copy of \<filename\>.\<ext\>


## Work Distribution

Through Discord, our team was able to communicate with 
one another to provide guidance and reminders of tasks for the 
project. With Github and Git, we were also able to pull from our 
main branch so that we could all work on the project individually 
while having the most up to date code. The work was distributed 
between the group through writing code, creating documents, as well 
as providing the group with guidance to ensure completion of the project.
	
I, Christian Verry, contributed by first providing information 
about the chapter 3 slides that would help guide us through the 
project and what the project consisted of. I also provided code for 
the init functions in both the sender.cpp and recv.cpp. As I struggled
with the other tasks within the project, my group members were able 
to help solve the problems and provide the code needed. Lastly, my 
contribution consisted of creating and writing parts of the README.md 
and helping with the design documentation.

I, Eddie Poulson, contributed by writing the code for all the functions
sans the init functions in sender.cpp and recv.cpp, which were written
by Christian Verry, and the main loop functions that were worked on by 
Greg Zhang. Furthermore, I provided support for any issues that my teammates
ran into, such as issues with segmentation faults due to some logic errors
in the main loop and small errors such as incorrect parameters in the init 
functions, as well as debugging and testing the program. 

I, Thanedh Sithisombath, contributed by looking up for information for the project 
from the slides and seeing on how should it be done for project. I also did some of 
the Todos and look at the others Todos. I also help my teammates by providing an way 
for all of us to share what we got through github by creating repository for the project.
I also ask to see what if there is anything missing from the project requirements.
Lastly, I try to see if there is anything is wrong in the code because I want to know if there 
are any kinds of errors that could be fix so that the program will work property.

I, Greg Zhang, contributed to the project by looking up examples and working on
the loop functions. I worked with my groupmates to resolve issues within the code. 
Lastly, I worked extensively on the design document of our project, creating it and 
gathering information and ideas from each of the other group members to do so.
